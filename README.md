# DotFiles
Vim and bash configuration


## Setup

1. First, clone repo into a directory, e.g. `~/SDK/dotfiles`

2. Install [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

3. Run `install.sh`. It will create links to your $PWD

4. Run vim, and execute `:PluginInstall` so VundleVim can install all the plugins.

You can configure the `~/.vimrc` file to add/remove plugins
